# Set object to be a boolean
###################################3

a = True
# True

# We can also use comparison operators to create booleans. We will go over all the comparison operators later on in the course.
1 > 2
# False

We can use None as a placeholder for an object that we don't want to reassign yet:
b = None
print(b)
# None
